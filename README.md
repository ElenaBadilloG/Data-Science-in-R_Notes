# Data-Science-in-R_Notes
My notes on R programming for Data Science, based on Coursera's Data Science Specialization series by Brian Caffo, Jeff Leek, and
Roger Peng (Johns Hopkins University).
Excludes the first course: The Data Scientist's Toolkit, hence, starts with R Programming course.
Each code file corresponds to a course's week material.
